   * Use Ember Meta to break cycles in the CP chains. Lets say we have a User model with a `friends` property that is a hasMany
   * relationship. If we have a user John and he has a friend Jane, that creates a two-way relationship. John is Jane's friends and vise
   * versa. If we were to go down the CP chain and get validations for John's friends, it would go to Jane, then to Jane's friends, which
   * would point back to John. This method tracks which models have been already visited and breaks the cycle.
